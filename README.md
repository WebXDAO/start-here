## 🎤 How do I set my membership public?

If you'd like to tell the world which organizations you belong to, you can display the avatar of the organizations on your profile. Check the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-your-membership-in-organizations/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership) for how to do this. OR you can also:

- Click on the `View all` text.
